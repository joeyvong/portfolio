I don't know if I should insert a general introduction you'd see on
other "first blog posts", but I am going to anyways. In a general
sense, I am not entirely too sure what I should post, but all I know
is I want to post stuff. Whether it be the things in my life, random
things about computer science that I find cool, or video games and my
thoughts on them.

All I've been told is to create a personal website by everyone, and
since most personal websites have blogs, I thought why not? Let my
thoughts drown in the vastness that is the internet.
